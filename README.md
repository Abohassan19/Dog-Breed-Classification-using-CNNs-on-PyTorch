## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in Udacity's DeepLearning Nanodegree! At the end of this project, the code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project.

## The Road Ahead

We break the notebook into separate steps.  Feel free to use the links below to navigate the notebook.

* Import Datasets
* Detect Humans
* Detect Dogs
* Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
* Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
* Test the Algorithm

## Some Interesting Results:

Final Model's Test Accuracy: 76% (641/836 images).
